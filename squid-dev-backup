51	Scout Tafoya	\nScout Tafoya is a blogger and filmmaker living in Doylestown, PA. He writes for and edits the arts blog Apocalypse Now and directs both feature length and short films, many of which are free to watch at honorszombiefilms.com. His list of peculiar achievements include teaching a class on the cultural importance of zombie movies while in high school, lecturing on Dystopian sci-fi at Villanova, shooting an eighty minute feature in only eight shots and calling it Tron Wayne Gacy on a dare, and making the world's first all-improv horror film about Quakers. Scout is in pre-production on a sci-fi homage to "My Own Private Idaho."\n\n	https://www.rogerebert.com/contributors/scout-tafoya	ebert	2018-11-08 21:09:23.23091	2018-11-12

58	Susan Wloszczyna	\nSusan Wloszczyna spent much of her nearly 30 years at USA TODAY as a senior entertainment reporter doing her dream job: Visiting the New Zealand film set of "The Lord of the Rings," being a zombie extra in George Romero’s "Land of the Dead" and interviewing countless show biz figures including icons (Vincent Price, Shirley Temple, Peter O’Toole, Mr. Rogers), A-list stars (George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Will Smith, Sandra Bullock, Denzel Washington) and big-name filmmakers (Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Jane Campion, Nancy Meyers, Spike Lee, Wes Anderson and Alexander Payne).Her positions at the newspaper included being a film reviewer for twelve years as well as the Life section copy desk chief. Now unchained from the grind of daily journalism, she is ready to view the world of movies with fresh eyes.\n\n	https://www.rogerebert.com/contributors/susan-wloszczyna	ebert	2018-11-08

It's believed that, once inside a body, all memories of the host human are gone. Some few free humans remain hidden from them, forming a resistance group. When an alien Seeker captures a girl named Melanie and puts a Wanderer in her body, she hopes to find out where the remaining humans are gathered, but Melanie, a strong fighter able to converse with the alien in her commandeered body, convinces the Wanderer to say nothing. Disappointed by the lack of progress (though suspecting an empathy for the human), the Seeker informs the Wanderer that she'll be removed and placed in a new host while she herself will enter Melanie. With human lives at risk, Melanie convinces Wanderer to run away and hide out with the humans, but finding them doesn't mean they'll allow an alien presence among them. Jared (Melanie's boyfriend) wants her dead, but Jeb (Melanie's uncle) wants to wait, and Ian, tasked with guarding her, finds himself siding with Jeb. As Ian begins to fall for Melanie, a strange love triangle develops, with Ian wanting Wanderer (inhabiting Melanie's body), Jared wanting Melanie (imprisoned inside her own body), and no one knowing any way to separate the two without killing both.","Language":"English","Country":"USA, Switzerland","Awards":"1 win \\u0026 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwNDg1MTAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk5ODI3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"9%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"35/100"}],"Metascore":"35","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"103,183","imdbID":"tt1517260","Type":"movie","DVD":"09 Jul 2013","BoxOffice":"$26,609,448","Production":"Open Road Films","Website":"http://www.facebook.com/thehostmovie","Response":"True"}

It took director Dan Mirvish (Slamdance co-founder) four years to track down the script and work with Feiffer - now 88 and still extremely active as a graphic novelist and playwright - to reinvigorate the project. Cast includes Oscar-winner Jim Rash, Richard Kind, Nancy Travis, Sasha Alexander, Bellamy Young and Mae Whitman, among others. Shot on Super16 film and Alexa. The film starts with post-collegiate Huey (a roguish ladies man) and Bernard (his nebbishy best friend). We flash forward 25 years and now Bernard is a successful New York bachelor, and Huey arrives on his doorstep looking old and washed up. As the two reconnect, Bernard starts a relationship with Huey's estranged daughter Zelda, an aspiring cartoonist. Huey slowly gets his mojo back and tries to seduce various women in Bernard's life, including on-again-off-again girlfriend Roz and workmate Mona. Zelda treats Bernard like Huey treats women, and Huey and Bernard fall back to their old ways as the ladies' man and the nebbish. But along the way, Huey reunites with his ex-wife, Aggie, his brother Marty and reconnects with Zelda. Bernard finally realizes that he may indeed wind up with a woman old enough to be his wife.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 wins \\u0026 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg0YmQzN2UtNDVlZS00YThkLWE0MDItM2YzOWY3Yjg3ODAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MDk5Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"72%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.3","imdbVotes":"34","imdbID":"tt4654016","Type":"movie","DVD":"08 Jun 2018","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Freestyle Digital Media","Website":"http://bernardandhueymovie.com/","Response":"True"}

He is basically a good but misguided person, due in part to the company he keeps, namely the friends he's known since high school and his partners in crime, Leo and Dennis, and feeling unloved or unaccepted by his preacher father, Martin Corrigan. The feeling associated with that latter sentiment is strengthened when his mother, Maddy Corrigan, confesses to him that Martin is not his biological father, that person being who was then a law student named Callum Crane with who she had a one time liaison and who she never told about the pregnancy. Nathan decides to search for Callum. Meanwhile, Callum is now married and a high powered lawyer, whose colleagues in the know consider amoral and devious. Just before he is appointed a federal judge, Callum rapes Sophie Lennon, a secretary new to the law firm where he works. Because of that situation, Callum has Sophie fired. Feeling otherwise helpless in the situation, Sophie threatens to expose what Callum did unless he gives up his judgeship, she unable to stomach the thought that he would be overseeing rape cases. Based on the event surrounding their auspicious initial meeting, Callum, who wants Sophie just to go away, ends up asking Nathan to kill her, not knowing that his and Nathan's encounter was not by chance and that he is Nathan's biological father. Callum hands Nathan a sealed envelope with a $5,000 retainer and the identity of the person he wants killed, the remaining $25,000 payment only if the hit is carried out. Nathan decides not even to open the envelope. In addition to not knowing about being Nathan's father, Callum is also unaware that Nathan has become friends - Nathan's hope is to be more than just friends - with Sophie through a chance meeting through Sophie's roommate, Tanya Duncan, who in turn is attracted to Nathan herself. The web gets more complex when Leo manages to steal the envelope, he who plans to carry out Callum's request in Nathan's place as Leo desperately needs the money to pay off a mobster.","Language":"English","Country":"UK, USA, Canada","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFlYzM2MGMtNGJiNi00ZTllLTlhMmEtODkxMTdlNjAxNmRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"40%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"2,858","imdbID":"tt0186183","Type":"movie","DVD":"12 Jun 2001","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Studio Home Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}

Human Flow, an epic film journey led by the internationally renowned artist Ai Weiwei, gives a powerful visual expression to this massive human migration. The documentary elucidates both the staggering scale of the refugee crisis and its profoundly personal human impact. Captured over the course of an eventful year in 23 countries, the film follows a chain of urgent human stories that stretches across the globe in countries including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, France, Greece, Germany, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, and Turkey. Human Flow is a witness to its subjects and their desperate search for safety, shelter and justice: from teeming refugee camps to perilous ocean crossings to barbed-wire borders; from dislocation and disillusionment to courage, endurance and adaptation; from the haunting lure of lives left behind to the unknown potential of the future. Human Flow comes at a crucial time when tolerance, compassion and trust are needed more than ever. This visceral work of cinema is a testament to the unassailable human spirit and poses one of the questions that will define this century: Will our global society emerge from fear, isolation, and self-interest and choose a path of openness, freedom, and respect for humanity?","Language":"English","Country":"Germany, USA, China, Palestine","Awards":"6 wins \\u0026 11 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODI2NjIzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQwMzUyMzI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"77/100"}],"Metascore":"77","imdbRating":"6.8","imdbVotes":"1,625","imdbID":"tt6573444","Type":"movie","DVD":"16 Feb 2017","BoxOffice":"$446,438","Production":"Amazon Studios and Participant Media","Website":"http://www.humanflow.com/","Response":"True"}

Fighting damp, cold and considerable local apathy she struggles to establish herself but soon her fortunes change for the better. By exposing the narrow minded local townsfolk to the best literature of the day including Nabokov's scandalizing \\"Lolita\\" and Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", she opens their eyes thereby causing a cultural awakening in a town which has not changed for centuries. Her activities bring her a kindred spirit and ally in the figure of Mr Brundish (Bill Nighy) who is himself sick of the town's stale atmosphere. But this mini social revolution soon brings her fierce enemies: she invites the hostility of the town's less prosperous shopkeepers and also crosses Mrs. Gamart (Patricia Clarkson), Hardborough's vengeful, embittered alpha female who is herself a wannabe doyenne of the local arts scene. When Florence refuses to bend to Gamart's will, they begin a struggle not just for the bookshop but for the very heart and soul of the town.","Language":"English","Country":"UK, Spain, Germany","Awards":"8 wins \\u0026 30 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDIzYjIyMGEtYzIyZS00OGY3LWI5ODYtN2M1YjAxOTA5OTgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI3MDEzMzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"54%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"62/100"}],"Metascore":"62","imdbRating":"6.5","imdbVotes":"3,824","imdbID":"tt3127022","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Greenwich Entertainment","Website":"https://www.bookshopthefilm.com/","Response":"True"}

The young actor surrendered his thriving career to become Kubrick's loyal right-hand man.

Insightful, emotionally charged anecdotes from actors, family, crew members, and key film industry professionals who worked with Kubrick and Leon add an important layer of detail and impact to the story. Filmworker enters the world of Leon Vitali and Stanley Kubrick from a unique perspective that highlights the nitty-gritty of the creative process.

Within a year, Neil Platt goes from being a healthy 30-something British bloke with a great sense of humor to becoming completely paralyzed from the neck down, thanks to the devastating illness he has inherited - known as ALS, MND, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. As his body gets weaker, his perspective on life changes. His humor remains, but new wisdom emerges: \\"It's amazing how adaptable we are when we have to be. It's what separates us and defines us as human beings.\\" Knowing he only has a few months left to live, and while he still has the ability to speak, Neil puts together a letter and memory box for his baby son Oscar and communicates his experience and thoughts about life in a blog - and in this film which he was determined to make. The directness of his communication mingles with images of the sensory details of a life well lived, and makes us revalue the ordinary. His blog posts form the film's narration as he tells his own story through memories and impressions of his life - the sheer joy of falling in love, of partying with his mates, of fast motorbike rides. Through his determination to share his final journey, he makes us ask questions about our own lives.","Language":"English","Country":"Denmark, UK","Awards":"3 wins \\u0026 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcyODUxODQ2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUyNjQ4MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}],"Metascore":"71","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"162","imdbID":"tt2392634","Type":"movie","DVD":"02 Jun 2015","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"SDI Productions Ltd.","Website":"http://www.iambreathingfilm.com","Response":"True"}

It's November 8th, 2008 and the CEC Future, a Danish-owned merchant ship, is on high alert. Sailing inside the pirate-infested swath of sea between Somalia and Yemen, the ship's captain blinks hard at the radar screen where a light begins to flash. This is it, Nozhkin thinks, and he's right. Machine guns sound on the boat's hull and for two months this 13-man crew will be held at the mercy of Somali pirates, helpless as hostage negotiations threaten their lives and cameras capture every move. The pirates' translator, Ishmael Ali, a single dad who may or may not have stumbled into this controversial role, puts in a call to the shipping magnate's CEO Per Gullestrup demanding an exorbitant 7 million dollars. The shipowner's response is the first of many misfires and communications to come. These two adversaries will have to become unlikely allies as they race against time in an attempt to keep the crew from being killed by their violent captors. Stolen Seas documents the story of 13 powerless men trapped on a ship, and why their captors feel justified in their tyranny. It's the story of a Somali translator who get's in over his head -trying to give his son a chance. With first hand accounts from leading experts on the subject refuting the common misconceptions, Stolen Seas explores theories of what drives a country to piracy, from every point of view. It is a film about a country on the brink, at the mercy of global capitalism in overdrive, and young boys with nothing to loose.","Language":"English, German, Tagalog, Somali, Italian, Russian","Country":"Estonia, Philippines, Denmark, USA, Somalia, Canada","Awards":"2 wins \\u0026 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NDE4OTMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEwNTQ5OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"71/100"}],"Metascore":"71","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"250","imdbID":"tt1981690","Type":"movie","DVD":"13 Nov 2014","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Independent Pictures","Website":"http://www.stolenseas.com/","Response":"True"}

He confesses to committing a series of particularly horrifying murders of exclusively female victims. He is imprisoned, awaiting the death sentence for his crimes. Yet the killings do not stop. They continue with all the same characteristics trademarks of the Shin-Hyun serial killings. The case is re-opened when two more bodies are discovered, both pregnant women. One is found in the city's landfill site, and the other is horrifically murdered on a public bus. Detective Mi Yun (played by Yum Jung-Ah), and her newly appointed partner, Detective Kang (played by Ji Jin-Hee), are assigned to the case. Mi Yun and Kang have difficulty working with each other, as their personalities and working methods are constantly in conflict. Detective Kang goes about his new job buoyantly and enthusiastically. He follows a new suspect, Huh, and eventually catches him in the act of brutally murdering a woman in a crowded techno bar. Huh is taken into custody after Kang shoots and wounds him at the scene of the crime. Once again, the case seems to be solved with this spectacular arrest. Yet the murders continue in copy-cat style. The police desperately hunt for new leads. They start an in-depth investigation of a Doctor Chu, who is Shin-Hyun's psychiatrist. But progress is frustrated when Dr Chu becomes a victim of the copy-cat killings herself. The murdered psychiatrist's former boyfriend quickly becomes the prime suspect, a fanatical character named Choi. All the pieces in the mystery are finally starting to fit together, and the case seems almost resolved. But all efforts are suddenly frustrated once again, when Choi takes his own life. But still, the killings do not stop with his death. The case gets more complicated, when even the police themselves appear to become suspects in the murders. In unraveling this mystery, everyone involved is pushed to the limits of human understanding.","Language":"Korean","Country":"South Korea","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3NjQwNDMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE3ODgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"80%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.0","imdbVotes":"1,614","imdbID":"tt0304120","Type":"movie","DVD":"24 May 2005","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Tartan Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}

Historians, scholars and filmmakers come together in Berlinger's cinematic exploration of the tangled web of responsibility that has driven a century of denial by the Turkish government and its strategic allies. Intent to Destroy (2017) is a timely reckoning with the large-scale suppression of a historical tragedy. Berlinger confronts the fraught task of shedding light on the Armenian Genocide - whose witnesses and descendants are still fighting to be officially acknowledged as such by the international community - how it was carried out during World War I as the reign of the Ottoman Empire drew to a close, and how it laid the groundwork for the genocides that followed.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"3 wins.","Poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzE2OTg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg2NzM3MzI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"92%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"8.5","imdbVotes":"246","imdbID":"tt6794462","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Abramorama","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
